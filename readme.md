Launching the Movie Website

Purpose of the Project:

The purpose of the project was to implement python lessons learned in class to develop a website that launches the movie posters of some of my favorite movies.  You can hover over each movie poster and you can launch the movie trailer for that particular movie. 

Steps to take to Launch Website:

1.       Install Python 2.79
Here is the link with instructions:

2.       There are three (4) files that need to be downloaded to your machine in order for the website to launch properly.  Given below is the full path name.
 
a.       C:\Users\home\Documents\UDACITY\Project_1\Movie\read_me.htm
b.      C:\Users\home\Documents\UDACITY\Project_1\Movie\entertainment_center.py
c.       C:\Users\home\Documents\UDACITY\Project_1\Movie\fresh_tomatoes.py
d.      C:\Users\home\Documents\UDACITY\Project_1\Movie\media.py
 
3.       Copy all three files in the same directory.  The website launches by opening entertainment_center.py in the editor of choice and executing the Run command which is found on the toolbar in Notepad++
 
Website Changes from Original:
 
There were several changes that I implemented to change the look and feel of the site.  I hope you enjoy them.
 
Changes to Python Code:
 
1.       Nine (9) of my favorite movie posters will appear when the site launches.
2.       I added more data for the movie tiles:
a.       Year- Year the movie was produced
b.      The run time in minutes converted to HH:MM format in the Python code
c.       The Rating of the movie
d.      My own one sentence thought on the movie
 

Changes to CSS / HTML

1.       I changed the title bar to say “Project 1:  Movie Trailers”
2.       Created additional <h2></h2> lines for additional information to be displayed
3.       Used the <b></b> to bold the title
4.       Used <i></i> to italicize my comments
5.       Changed the background color by altering the hex codes
6.       Changes the text color by switching the hex codes
7.       Changed the color of the tile background when you hover over it by changing the hex code
8.       Put a border around the hovering background and changed the text color to match the background.
